1. nurses can find the patients by typing their last names because they want to target the right patients
2. nurses decide which vaccines the patient should take and are able to choose those vaccines and its type of series in the next page
- nurses can also choose any random date to start the series
3. nurses can view a table of information that contains the patients' names, appointment dates of all past, current, upcoming doses, the number of dosage of each vaccine, the vaccine names
- can mark if the dose has been completed or not
- the upcoming appointments are calculated based on the 1st chosen date.
4. nurses / receptionists can update the appointment date of the 2nd / 3rd dose and the program will update the next dose's appointment date
5. nurses can see the vaccine's names and dosing intervals information in a textbox below the above table of the same page, also the source link (to explain why those appointment dates make sense)
(1st dose = random date 
=> 2nd dose = patients can choose any time from the exact day + 7 upcoming business days
=> 3rd dose = patients can choose any time from the exact day + 7 upcoming business days)
(1st dose = random date 
=> 2nd dose = patients can choose any time from the exact day + 7 upcoming business days
=> 3rd dose = patients can choose any time from the exact day + 7 upcoming business days
=> 4th dose = patients can choose any time from the exact day + 7 upcoming business days)
